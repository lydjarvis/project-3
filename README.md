## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to keep track of what tasks are completed and what tasks are not completed.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete tasks that are completed or was typed by mistake.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the due dates of all my tasks.

## Future Improvments:
- I would like to add more css

- I would like to be able to submit different tasks
